SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES, SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU; IN SUCH CASE, THE FOREGOING SHALL BE READ TO PROVIDE THE MOST LIMITED LIABILITY PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

TERM AND TERMINATION; AUTOMATIC CHARGES

Each Service term commences upon the date of the Order and shall continue for a period of one year, unless otherwise agreed to in the Order (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated as set forth below. Thereafter, the Order will automatically renew, and your credit card or other selected payment method will be automatically charged, for the period specified in the Order, or, if no such term is specified, on an annual basis at the then-current monthly rates (the “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Service Term”) unless either party provides the other party with written notice of its intention not to renew prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term.

Either party may terminate an Order upon written notice to the other party if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such default continues for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the nature of the breach. We may also terminate this Agreement or any Order at any time and for any reason effective upon notice to you.

You may not use any Services or materials after the expiration or termination of your Order for the Services. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, you will be deemed to have forfeited any unused Service credits or referral credits.

SUSPENSION

We may suspend some or all of the Services without liability to you if: (i) you fail to cure any default within the cure period specified above; (ii) we determine that the Services are being used, have been used, or will, with commercially reasonable certainty, be used in breach of this Agreement; (iii) we reasonably believe that the Services have been accessed or utilized in any way by a third party without your consent; or (iv) suspension of Services is reasonably necessary to protect us or our products and services. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you advance notice of a suspension and a chance to cure the violation on which the suspension is based, unless we determine, in our reasonable judgment, that an immediate suspension is necessary to protect our network and our customers from an imminent, significant operational, network integrity or security risk. Suspensions based on your breach of this Agreement will not relieve your obligation to pay for the suspended Services during the period of suspension. Any suspension imposed under this Section will be lifted upon your cure of the breach causing the suspension. In the event you are unable to cure the breach within fifteen (15) days of our notice, the suspension may be treated as a termination for cause. During the suspension period, we shall have the right to deny access to, and/or, destroy data stored on the compromised server or account. We may, in our sole discretion, allow access to a suspended account.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Your use of the Services is subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, available at https://theeventscalendar.com/privacy-policy/. You acknowledge that you have read and understand the Privacy Policy, and you consent to the use of any personal information you provide in accordance with the terms of, and for the purpose set forth in, the Privacy Policy.

You are solely responsible for the security of online access to Services, including your account, and you must take precautions to protect the confidentiality of your password and other login information. You shall not share your password or login information with any other person or entity. You shall contact us immediately if you suspect unauthorized use of your password or login information or any other unauthorized activity on your account. You are and will be responsible for all activities conducted on and with the Services that make use of your account information, and for any charges or fees incurred by the use of that account information, including any use you may subsequently contend you did not authorize. We may justifiably assume that any communication or instructions received through any electronic systems and placed under your account or password were placed or authorized by you.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION; CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY WAIVER

The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including the interpretation, enforcement and any alleged breach thereof) or the Services shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against us any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

By using the Services, you agree to the above arbitration terms. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. You understand your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, and decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Any proceeding to enforce arbitration, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration provision is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Ingham County, Michigan. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. If any action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this Agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

GENERAL TERMS

You represent and warrant that you are not on the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controls list of Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons to whom we are legally prohibited to provide the Services. You may not use any Service for the development, design, manufacture, production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, weapons of mass destruction, or missiles, in a country listed in Country Groups D: 4 and D: 3, as set forth in Supplement No. 1 to the Part 740 of the United States Export Administration Regulations, nor may you provide administrative access to any Service to any person (including any natural person or government or private entity) that is located in or is a national of any country that is embargoed or highly restricted under United States export regulations. Neither party will use the other party’s name, logo or service marks, for any commercial purpose without the other party’s prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may use our name and logo to positively publicize that you use the Services, and we may include your name on our customer list, website, partner portal, and publications. You shall not assign, voluntarily or by operation of law, any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent. This Agreement shall be binding on the parties and respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement creates, or will be deemed to create, third-party beneficiaries of or under this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, agency, joint venture, or employer/employee relationship between the parties. Each party is responsible for the actions of, and its obligations to, its own personnel, contractors, and subcontractors. Neither party shall be liable, nor shall any credit allowance or other remedy be extended, for any failure of performance or equipment due to causes beyond such party’s reasonable control, and if we are unable to deliver any Service as a result of such event, you shall not be obligated to pay us for the affected Service for so long as we are unable to deliver that Service. The failure by any party to this Agreement to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that provision. All waivers must be in writing to be enforceable hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, any notice or other communication regarding this Agreement may be sent by U.S. mail (first-class, airmail or express mail), commercial courier, or electronic mail. Notices to us shall be sent to: CherryApp Studios, 2703 Ena Drive, Lansing MI 48917, Attn: General Counsel, and notices to you will be sent to the contact information set forth in your Order, or at such other addresses as either party may designate in writing. If any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such declaration and such declaration shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The parties consent and agree that this Agreement and any Order may be entered into electronically by way of electronic signatures (for example, by electronically clicking a box confirming agreement or utilizing third party software such as DocuSign), and any such electronic signatures shall be binding. This Agreement, together with all Orders, embodies the entire agreement and understanding us and you with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any kind not expressly set forth in this Agreement will affect, or be used to interpret, change or restrict, the express terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each party’s obligations under Section 5 (Representations, Warranties and Covenants), Section 6 (Indemnification), Section 7 (Limitation of Liability) and this Section 12 and shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Michigan (without regard to its conflict of law principles).
